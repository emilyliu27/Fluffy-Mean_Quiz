			You are Fluffy... most of the time. You are usually the Fluffy in a relationship. However, just like how you think that burgers should not be gatekept out of the dinner table, you also do not like confining yourself to one role. You are occassionally open to being the Mean One every once in a while and also depending on which type of person your partner is. As the Fluffy, you are always seeking tenderness and affection, no matter who else is watching. You are known to be super cheesy with your partner, and your friends and partner always bully you for it. Still, you are not afraid to display your affection and will constantly remind everyone how much you love your partner. You eagerly take on the role of seeing just how far you can push your partner to display affection. On the occassions that you take a get tired from all the fluff and become Mean, you reject tenderness and hate anything cheesy (at least superficially). You hate displaying affection when you are in public. You will make fun of your partner for being cheesy in public. However, deep down, you do very much enjoy the attention and love that your partner gives you. <br><br>
			You will thrive most in a relationship with a Vers Mean One. They will balance out your incessant cheesiness. They will also keep you in check to make sure that you do not end up being too over the top with your affection. Even though they are "mean" on the outside, you enjoy the fact that all of their affection is reserved for you. Like you, they also do not like to be confined to one role and will be open to occasionally switching roles with you. You may also be compatible with a Mean One, a True Vers, another Vers Fluffy, or sometimes even a Fluffy but to a lesser extent, and it will heavily depend on the person you are with.
