			You are definitely always the Fluffy. You accept hot dogs and lemonade into the sandwich and juice community, respectively, with open arms, but you can't handle a little with of static in your water. Well aren't you just a big softie! You are always seeking tenderness and affection, no matter who else is watching. You are known to be super cheesy with your partner, and your friends and partner always bully you for it. Still, you are not afraid to display your affection and will constantly remind everyone how much you love your partner. It is often your job to push your partner to display affection, and it is a job that you take on eagerly. <br><br>
			You will thrive most in a relationship with a Mean One. They will balance out your incessant cheesiness. They will also keep you in check to make sure that you do not end up being too over the top with your affection. Even though they are "mean" on the outside, you enjoy the fact that all of their affection is reserved for you. Plus, your favorite thing to do is to see how far you can push your Mean One in terms of displaying affectiion. You may be compatible with other Vers people as well, but to a far lesser extent, as too much fluff coming from both sides in a relationship is just too much.
