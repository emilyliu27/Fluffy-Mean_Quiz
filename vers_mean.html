			You are mean... most of the time. You are usually the Mean One in a relationship. However, you raw dog your spinach, which obviously shows that you are an adventurous individual who doesn't like to be confined to one role. You are occassionally open to being the Fluffy every once in a while and also depending on which type of person your partner is. As the Mean One, you reject tenderness of any form and hate anything cheesy (at least superficially). You hate displaying affection when you are in public. You will constantly make fun of your partner for being cheesy in public. However, deep down, you do very much enjoy the attention and love that your partner gives you. On the occasions that you become Fluffy, you seek tenderness and affection, no matter who else is watching. You can be super cheesy with your partner, and your friends and partner will bully you for it. Still, you are not afraid to display your affection and will constantly remind everyone how much you love your partner. <br><br>
			You will thrive most in a relationship with a Vers Fluffy. They will shower you with the tenderness that you always seem reluctant to give. They might drive you crazy sometimes with how over the top they can be, but you love it anyway. You are not usually one to initiate affection, but your Vers Fluffy will be persistent in making sure that you eventually reciprocate at least some of the affection they give you. Like you, they also do not like to be confined to one role and will be open to occasionally switching roles with you. You may also be compatible with a Fluffy, a True Vers, another Vers Mean One, or sometimes even a Mean One but to a lesser extent, and it will heavily depend on the person you are with.
