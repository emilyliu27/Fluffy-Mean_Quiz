			In every successful romantic relationship, there is one person who is the Fluffy and one person who is the Mean One. While a person's role in a relationship can differ from partner to partner, everyone is still predisposed to some point on the Fluffy-Mean spectrum. Where someone falls on the spectrum determines which role they are more likely to take on in a relationship.<br><br>
