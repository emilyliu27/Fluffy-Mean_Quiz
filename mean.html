			You are definitely always the Mean One. You gatekeep hotdogs, you prefer pie over cake... You sound just as salty as your hot chocolate! You reject tenderness of any form and hate anything cheesy (at least superficially). You hate displaying affection when you are in public. You will constantly make fun of your partner for being cheesy in public. However, deep down, you do very much enjoy the attention and love that your partner gives you. <br><br>
			You will thrive the most in a relationship with a Fluffy. They will shower you with the tenderness that you always seem reluctant to give. They might drive you crazy sometimes with how over the top they can be, but you love it anyway. You are not usually one to initiate affection, but your Fluffy will be persistent in making sure that you eventually reciprocate at least some of the affection they give you. You may be compatible with other Vers people as well, but to a far lesser extent, as too much meanness and lack of fluff will cause the connection to fizzle out.
