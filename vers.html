			You are right in the middle of the spectrum! You seem to have a mix of opinions, just like how you are open to both roles of either being the Fluffy or the Mean One. As the Fluffy, you seek tenderness and affection, no matter who else is watching. You can be super cheesy with your partner, and your friends and partner will bully you for it. Still, you are not afraid to display your affection and will constantly remind everyone how much you love your partner. As the Mean One, you reject tenderness of any form and hate anything cheesy (at least superficially). You do not display affection when you are in public. You will make fun of your partner for being cheesy in public. However, deep down, you do very much enjoy the attention and love that your partner gives you. Which role you take depends on which type of person your partner is. If you date a Fluffy, you become the Mean One. If you date a Mean One, you become a Fluffy. As a True Vers, you may also like to switch roles every once in a while, or you may possess the traits of both a Fluffy and a Mean One at the same time. <br><br>
			You are most compatible with another True Vers like yourself. They, like yourself, will be open to switching and mixing roles every once in a while and creating a hybrid dynamic in the relationship. Because you are flexible, you are also compatible with all other types of people, and you will accept whatever role complements your partner best. Though to a slightly lesser extent, since the dynamic may become more rigid. It also very heavily depends on the person you are with.
